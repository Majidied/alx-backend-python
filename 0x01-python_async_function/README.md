# 0x01-python_async_function

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, introducing concepts and practices to handle concurrency using async and await syntax. It aims to provide hands-on experience with asynchronous functions, improving efficiency and performance in Python applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of asynchronous programming
- Use async and await to define and run asynchronous functions
- Manage concurrency with asyncio library
- Implement asynchronous tasks and handle their results

## Project Structure

The project contains several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of asynchronous programming:

1. **Task 1**: Introduction to async and await
2. **Task 2**: Using asyncio for concurrency
3. **Task 3**: Implementing asynchronous functions
4. **Task 4**: Handling multiple asynchronous tasks

Each task has its own directory with detailed instructions and code examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `0x01-python_async_function` project:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd alx-backend-python/0x01-python_async_function
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the instructions in each task directory to complete the exercises. You can run the asynchronous Python scripts using:
```sh
python script_name.py
```
